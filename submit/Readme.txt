Just put the two files to the corresponding directory and I think it won't be hard for you to compile it.

cpp 	--> "my code" directory
h	--> "CS174a template" directory

It is all done, it's just I could enlarge/shrink a sphere while using the provided sphere function, as it would be unfeasible to enable a ellipsoid too. Although I don't think it would affect my grade of this assignment.

Moreover, I have used two kinds of the hierarchy structure. 

For tree -- populate the cubes first, then draw at one line. Then the sphere.
For wasp -- treat each part -- the body, head, tail, wings and legs as different objects, let them populate themselves, then draw as times goes by.

They all works pretty well.
